# Indigo Common Lisp

Common Lisp with algebraic data types, strong static typing, and pattern patching definitions

# Motivaton for ADTs and Strong Typing

* easier formal verification of programs
* more reusable code and data through parametrics
* bugs caught at compile time = faster development
* pattern matching + ADTs = cleaner code
* allows for more advanced constraint/logic programming
* done right, better runtime performance

# TODO
* finish ADT specification macros
* register parametric function type signatures
* test parametric function type checking
* Total Function verification
* add more features from Haskell
* profile generated functions
