# Indigo Common Lisp

# Motivaton for ADTs and Strong Typing

* easier formal verification of programs
* more reusable code and data through parametrics and ADTs
* bugs caught at compile time = faster development
* pattern matching + ADTs = cleaner code
* allows for more advanced constraint/logic programming
